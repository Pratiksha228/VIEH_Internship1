**Employee Turnover Prediction:** The Main reason is that where employees leaves the company in between or they want to leave the company in future for them my goal is to understand what factors contribute most to employee turnover and create a model that can predict if a certain employee will leave the company or not. 

Machine Learning Algorithms that I have used for predicting accuracy of the model are as follows:<br>
a) Logistic Regression<br>
b) Random Forest<br>
c) Decision Tree<br>

Model Flowchart:<br>

Accuracy of the model with each supervised machine learning algorithms:<br>
a) Logistic Regression: Accuracy score of the logistic regression is about 0.76 , which is not so good.<br>

b) Decision Tree: The accuracy score of the Decision Tree model is about 0.97. Which is quite good compare to Logistic Regression.<br>

c) Random Forest: The accuracy score of the Random Forest model is about 0.98. So We will, train our model using Random Forest hence, it is giving the best accuracy.

According to our Random Forest classification model, the above aspects show the most important features which will influence whether an employee will leave the company, in ascending order. Random Forest algorithm provides the better accuracy that other machine learning algorithms.

**Deployment of the Model:**

In this project, I have deploy the Machine Learning model as a Web Application using **Python’s Django framework**. It will convert the python model file into a much more 
dynamic and powerful web application that can accept input from user’s and generate application.
